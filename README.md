# UNet Segmentation Project



---

## Project Overview

UNet is a convolutional neural network specifically tailored for image segmentation tasks. Originally developed for biomedical image segmentation, UNet has proven effective in identifying object boundaries and performing pixel-level predictions across various domains. In this project, weâ€™ll walk through the process of implementing UNet, training it on an example dataset, and evaluating its segmentation performance.

### Key Features

- **UNet Model Architecture**: Overview and explanation of the UNet architecture.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily adjust model parameters like input size, depth, and number of filters.
- **Training Pipeline**: Train UNet on a dataset with custom data augmentation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Compute metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union), accuracy, and loss over time.
- **Visualization**: Visualize training results and evaluate segmentation accuracy with heatmaps and masks.
